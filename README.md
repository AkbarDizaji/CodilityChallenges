# CodilityChallenges
In this repository, I solved the challenges that I found in Codility.


All codes were implemented by PHP.


For each problem, you can find the independent directory and in that, you can these 2 files:

1. Problem Description: As its name refers, you can find the problem here.
2. solution.php: In this file, I developed the algorithm.

All solutions got 100% in correctness and performance. In Some cases we have 2 approaches:

1. The main which gets the best record.
2. The common solution which may come to mind first.
